# Math Problem Generator - Developer Assessment Starter Kit

## Overview

This is a starter kit for building an AI-powered math problem generator application. The goal is to create a standalone prototype that uses AI to generate math word problems suitable for Primary 5 students, saves the problems and user submissions to a database, and provides personalized feedback.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Supabase
- **AI Integration**: Google Generative AI (Gemini)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd math-problem-generator
```

### 2. Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a free account
2. Create a new project
3. Go to Settings â†’ API to find your:
   - Project URL (starts with `https://`)
   - Anon/Public Key

### 3. Set Up Database Tables

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `database.sql`
3. Click "Run" to create the tables and policies
4. **Additional Schema Update**: Run the contents of `add_is_revealed_column.sql` to add the `is_revealed` column for the reveal answer feature

### 4. Get Google API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key for Gemini

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```
2. Edit `.env.local` and add your actual keys:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_actual_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_supabase_anon_key
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_google_api_key
   ```

### 6. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 7. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Your Task

### 1. Implement Frontend Logic (`app/page.tsx`)

Complete the TODO sections in the main page component:

- **generateProblem**: Call your API route to generate a new math problem
- **submitAnswer**: Submit the user's answer and get feedback

### 2. Create Backend API Route (`app/api/math-problem/route.ts`)

Create a new API route that handles:

#### POST /api/math-problem (Generate Problem)

- Use Google's Gemini AI to generate a math word problem
- The AI should return JSON with:
  ```json
  {
    "problem_text": "A bakery sold 45 cupcakes...",
    "final_answer": 15
  }
  ```
- Save the problem to `math_problem_sessions` table
- Return the problem and session ID to the frontend

#### POST /api/math-problem/submit (Submit Answer)

- Receive the session ID and user's answer
- Check if the answer is correct
- Use AI to generate personalized feedback based on:
  - The original problem
  - The correct answer
  - The user's answer
  - Whether they got it right or wrong
- Save the submission to `math_problem_submissions` table
- Return the feedback and correctness to the frontend

#### GET /api/math-problem/[sessionId] (Get Problem)

- Retrieve an existing problem by session ID
- Used for the "Continue Answering" feature

#### POST /api/math-problem/reveal (Reveal Answer)

- Generate AI explanation for the correct answer
- Save as a special submission with `is_revealed: true`
- Used when users choose to reveal the answer instead of solving

#### POST /api/math-problem/history (Get History)

- Retrieve problem history with all submissions
- Supports multiple submissions per problem
- Returns detailed submission data including reveal status

### 3. Requirements Checklist

- [x] AI generates appropriate Primary 5 level math problems
- [x] Problems and answers are saved to Supabase
- [x] User submissions are saved with feedback
- [x] AI generates helpful, personalized feedback
- [x] UI is clean and mobile-responsive
- [x] Error handling for API failures
- [x] Loading states during API calls

## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and import your repository
3. Add your environment variables in Vercel's project settings
4. Deploy!

## Assessment Submission

When submitting your assessment, provide:

1. **GitHub Repository URL**: Make sure it's public
2. **Live Demo URL**: Your Vercel deployment
3. **Supabase Credentials**: Add these to your README for testing:
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL: [Your Supabase Project URL]
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: [Your Supabase Anon Key]
   ```

## Implementation Notes

_Please fill in this section with any important notes about your implementation, design decisions, challenges faced, or features you're particularly proud of._

### My Implementation:

- **Complete Frontend Integration**: Implemented all TODO sections in `app/page.tsx` with full API integration for problem generation and answer submission
- **Advanced History System**: Created a comprehensive history page (`app/history/page.tsx`) with collapsible problem cards, multiple submission tracking, and "Continue Answering" functionality
- **Reveal Answer Feature**: Added a unique "Reveal Answer" system that allows users to see correct answers with AI-generated explanations, tracked separately from user submissions
- **Modern UI/UX**: Designed a clean, minimalist interface using Tailwind CSS with a parent-friendly aesthetic while maintaining playful elements for students
- **Database Schema Enhancement**: Added `is_revealed` column to track revealed answers separately from user submissions
- **Smart State Management**: Implemented localStorage for session tracking and intelligent state management to prevent duplicate correct submissions
- **Comprehensive API Routes**: Created multiple API endpoints including problem generation, submission handling, history retrieval, and answer revelation
- **Error Handling & Loading States**: Added robust error handling and smooth loading states throughout the application
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive design that works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## Additional Features (Implemented)

Beyond the basic requirements, I've implemented several advanced features:

- [x] **Problem history view** - Complete history page with collapsible problem cards
- [x] **Multiple submission tracking** - Users can submit multiple answers for each problem
- [x] **Continue Answering feature** - Users can return to unsolved problems from history
- [x] **Reveal Answer system** - Users can reveal correct answers with AI explanations
- [x] **Smart state management** - Prevents duplicate correct submissions
